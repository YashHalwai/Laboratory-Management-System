# Laboratory-Management-System
Laboratory Register using Python (Digital Yellow Book)


This project aims to solve college faculty problems of maintaining student data in a particular laboratory.

Simply I was trying to develop it and it was successful in the first stage as I could develop an online yellow book of our college later in the team now, 
we all are focusing on other parts to make it a web-based application.

Faculty can enter student data and then mark their attendance with these students can also review their marks and finally, 
HOD will check for final submission.
